# Marathi Neurons

Marathi Neurons is attempt to learn Neural Network from famous youtube course ['Neural Network : Zero to Hero'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) by Andrez Karpathy. In process of learning, we try to use our custom data (i.e. Marathi text) instead of using data provided by Andrej Karpathy.

It contains Notebooks for processing and generating Marathi text with help of learning material provided by respective youtube course.

All input generation and processing script are developed by us. We are using material suggested by course in terms of getting clearity of working of Neural Network. We will tune same learning material according to our need of marathi text generation.

Please let us know regarding this attempt of learning Neural Network.
